1. New  -> New Project -> Command Line Tool


2. Name it and select C++


3. 
    Click on your project from the left menu. 
    Click the "build settings" tab from the top. 
    Filter all. 
    Scroll to “Search Paths”. Under header search paths, for debug and release, set the path to /usr/local/include
    ( is /opt/local/include in our case )


4. 
    Click on your project from the left menu. File->New->New Group
    Name the group OpenCV Frameworks. 

    Select the folder (group) you just labeled, “OpenCV Frameworks” in the left menu. Go to File -> add Files
    ( this means, go to File->add Files to "Hi" )
    
    Select the Right Folder to add the dylibs
    Type “/”, which will allow you to manually go to a folder. Go to -> /usr/local/lib
    
    Select both of these files, libopencv_core.dylib, libopencv_highgui.dylib, and click “Add”. (you may need to add other library files from this folder to run other code.)
    
5.   
    You must include this line of code in the beginning of your main.cpp file:


#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>.
TEST CODE
Copy this code into your main.cpp file. It should open up a small window that is half shaded. (There may be some formatting errors in copy pasting this code into Xcode, but it should be easy to clean up.)

#include <iostream>
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    // Open the file.
    IplImage *img = cvCreateImage( cvSize(100,200), IPL_DEPTH_8U, 3); 

    //if (!img) {
    //    printf("Error: Couldn't open the image file.\n");
    //    return 1;
    //}
                                        
    // Display the image.
    cvNamedWindow("Image:", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE);
    cvShowImage("Image:", img);
    
    // Wait for the user to press a key in the GUI window.
    cvWaitKey(0);

    // Free the resources.
    cvDestroyWindow("Image:");
    cvReleaseImage(&img);
                                                                                
    return 0;

}
